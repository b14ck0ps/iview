## Display image, show mouse position and pixel values from web browser

If you want to view the images, and want to know the mouse location and pixel values, you may install some image viewer(s). I am at the same boat. After some research, I found that there is no light-weighted image viewer which can show the pixel values at Linux platform up to my best knowledge. So I decide to write one by myself. It turns out web browser + Javascript are good enough to do this.
